# Common

This npm package holds shared components. It is referenced by `unified-tasklist-react-frontend` as a dependency and can be referenced as a peer-dependency in a Camunda microservice's library holding react code for its user tasks.

In this showcase it consists of only interfaces used by the user tasks list but it may also be extended by shared UI components.
